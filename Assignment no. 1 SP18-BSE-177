Q1) What is cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet., storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet (the cloud) to offer flexible resources and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.
Benefits:
Efficient in its use of resources
Scalable
Elastic
Self-managing
Highly available and accessible
Inter-operable and portable
Properties:
1.	Resource Efficient: Computing and network resources are pooled to provide services to multiple users. Resource allocation is dynamically adapted according to user demand.
2.	Elasticity: Computing resources can be rapidly and elastically provisioned to scale up and released to scale down based on consumers demand.
3.	Self-managing services: A consumer can provision cloud services, such as web applications, server time, processing, storage, and network as needed and automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
4.	Accessible and highly available: Cloud resources are available over the network anytime and anywhere and are accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by different types of platforms.
Examples of cloud computing include:
Google Docs, Microsoft Office 365: Users can access Google Docs and Microsoft Office 365 through the internet. Users can be more productive because they can access work presentations and spreadsheets stored in the cloud at any time from anywhere on any device.
Email, Calendar, Skype, Whats App: Emails, calendars, Skype and Whats App take advantage of the cloud's ability to provide users with access to that's remotely so they can access their personal that's on any device, whenever and wherever they want.
Zoom: Zoom is a cloud-based software platform for video and audio conferencing that records meetings and saves them to the cloud, enabling users to access them anywhere and at any time.
AWS Lambda: Lambda allows developers to run code for applications or back-end services without having to provision or manage servers. The pay-as-you-go model constantly scales with an organization to accommodate real-time changes in that's usage and that's storage.

Categories:
Cloud Computing can be divided into three main categories:
1.	Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
2.	Platform as a service (PaaS)
3.	Software as a service (SaaS)
A cloud can be Public or Private:
Private or public, the goal of cloud computing is to provide easy, scalable access to computing resources and IT services.
Private cloud:
A private cloud is a proprietary network or a data center that supplies hosted services to a limited number of people, with certain access and permissions settings.
Public cloud:
A public cloud sells services to anyone on the internet.
Working:
Cloud computing works by allowing client devices to access data over the internet, from remote servers, databases and computers.An internet network connection links the front end (includes the accessing client device, browser, network and cloud software applications) with the back end, which consists of databases, servers and computers).  The back end functions as a repository, storing data that is accessed by the front end Communications between the front and back ends are managed by a central server. The central server relies on protocols to facilitate the exchange of data. The central server uses both software and middleware to manage connectivity between differentclient devices and cloud servers. Typically, there will be a dedicated server for each individual application.
Question 2: What are the different types of Cloud?
There are four main categories of cloud computing are:
Public Cloud, Private cloud, Hybrid cloud, Community cloud

Public Cloud 
Public cloud is cloud computing thats delivered via the internet and shared across organizations.
In a public cloud, individual businesses share on premise and access to basic computer infrastructure (servers, storage, networks, development platforms etc.) provided by a CSP. Each company shares the CSPs infrastructure with the other companies that have subscribed to the cloud. Payment is usually pay as-you-go with no minimum time requirements. Some CSPs derive revenue from advertising and offer free public clouds.
Public clouds are usually based on massive hardware installations distributed in locations throughout the country or across the globe. Their size enables economies of scale that permit maximum scalability to meet requirements as a companys needs expand or contract, maximum flexibility to meet surges in demand in real time, and maximum reliability in case of hardware failures.
Public clouds are highly cost effective because the business only pays for the computer resources it uses. In addition, the business has access to state-of-the-art computer infrastructure without having to purchase it and hire IT staff to install and maintain it.
Their Basic characteristics are:
1.	Homogeneous infrastructure
2.	Common policies
3.	Shared resources and multi-tenancy
4.	Leased or rented infrastructure
5.	Economies of scale
Some of the Public cloud examples are
1.	AWS/EC2 (Amazon)
2.	Azure (Microsoft)
3.	Google Cloud Platform.
4.	Rackspace.
Private Cloud 
Private cloud is cloud computing that is dedicated solely to your organization.
In a private cloud, a business has access to infrastructure in the cloud that is not shared with anyone else. The business typically deploys its own platforms and software applications on the cloud infrastructure. The business infrastructure usually lies behind a firewall that is accessed through the company intranet over encrypted connections. Payment is often based on a fee-per-unit-time model.
Private clouds have the significant advantage of being able to provide enhanced levels of security and privacy because computer infrastructure is dedicated to a single client. Sarbanes Oxley, PCI and HIPAA compliance are all possible in a private cloud. In addition, private cloud CSPs are more likely to customize the cloud to meet a company needs.
The cloud infrastructure belongs to and is operated by only one organization. Their Basic characteristics are:
1.	Heterogeneous infrastructure
2.	Customized policies
3.	Dedicated resources
4.	In-house infrastructure
5.	End-to-end control
Some of the examples are:
1.	Eucalyptus System
2.	Open Nebula
3.	OpenStack

Hybrid Cloud
Hybrid cloud is any environment that uses both public and private clouds.
In a hybrid cloud, a company cloud deployment is split between public and private cloud infrastructure. Sensitive data remains within the private cloud where high security standards can be maintained. Operations that do not make use of sensitive data are carried out in the public cloud where infrastructure can scale to meet demands and costs are reduced.
Hybrid clouds are well suited to carrying out big data operations on non-sensitive data in the public cloud while keeping sensitive data protected in the private cloud. Hybrid clouds also give companies the option of running their public-facing applications or their capacity intensive development platforms in the public portion of the cloud while their sensitive data remains protected.

Community Cloud
Community cloud is cloud computing in which infrastructure is shared between several organizations from a specific community with common concerns, whether managed internally or by a third-party and hosted internally or externally.
Community clouds are a recent variation on the private cloud model that provide a complete cloud solution for specific business communities. Businesses share infrastructure provided by the CSP for software and development tools that are designed to meet community needs. In addition, each business has its own private cloud space that is built to meet the security, privacy and compliance needs that are common in the community.
Community clouds are an attractive option for companies in the health, financial or legal spheres that are subject to strict regulatory compliance. They are also well-suited to managing joint projects that benefit from sharing community-specific software applications or development platforms.
The recent development of community clouds illustrates how cloud computing is evolving. CSPs can combine different types of clouds with different service models to provide businesses with attractive cloud solutions that meet a company needs.

3.	What are the cloud service models?
Cloud computing is not a single piece of technology like a microchip or a cellphone. Rather, it's a system primarily comprised of three services: software-as-a-service (SaaS), infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), and platform-as-a-service (PaaS).
1.	Software as a Service (SaaS):
Software as a Service offers applications that are accessed over the web and are not managed by your company, but by the software provider. This relieves your organization from the constant pressure of software maintenance, infrastructure management, network security, data availability, and all the other operational issues involved with keeping applications up and running. 
2.	Platform as a Service (PaaS):
Platform as a Service is halfway between Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). It offers access to a cloud-based environment in which users can build and deliver applications without the need of installing and working with IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), which are often very expensive. Additionally, users can often customize the features they want included with their subscription.

3.	Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):
Infrastructure as a service offers a standardized way of acquiring computing capabilities on demand and over the web. Such resources include storage facilities, networks, processing power, and virtual private servers. In this service model, customers do not need to manage infrastructure, it is up to the provider to guarantee the contracted amount of resources and availability.
