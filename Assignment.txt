1. What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services -- from applications to storage and processing power -- 
typically over the internet and on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Rather than owning their own computing infrastructure or data centers, companies can rent access to anything from 
applications to storage from a cloud service provider.
One benefit of using cloud computing services is that firms can avoid the upfront cost and complexity of owning and maintaining 
their own IT infrastructure, and instead simply pay for what they use when they use it.
In turn, providers of cloud computing services can benefit from significant economies of scale by delivering the same 
services to a wide range of customers.


2. What are the different types of cloud?
There are four main types of cloud computing: private clouds, public clouds, hybrid clouds, and community clouds. 
Private Clouds
Private clouds are loosely defined as cloud environments solely dedicated to a single end-user or group, where the environment 
usually runs behind that user or group's firewall. All clouds become private clouds when the underlying IT infrastructure is 
dedicated to a single customer with completely isolated access.
But private clouds no longer have to be sourced from on-prem IT infrastructure. Organizations are now building private clouds 
on rented, vendor-owned data centers located off-premises, which makes any location and ownership rules obsolete.

Public Clouds
Public clouds are cloud environments typically created from IT infrastructure not owned by the end-user. Some of the largest 
public cloud providers include Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.
Traditional public clouds always ran off-premises, but today's public cloud providers have started offering cloud services on 
clients’ on-premise data centers. This has made location and ownership distinctions obsolete.
All clouds become public clouds when the environments are partitioned and redistributed to multiple tenants. Fee structures 
aren't necessary characteristics of public clouds anymore, since some cloud providers (like the Massachusettes Open Cloud) allow tenants to use their clouds for free. The bare-metal IT infrastructure used by public cloud providers can also be abstracted and sold as IaaS, or it can be developed into a cloud platform sold as PaaS.

Hybrid Clouds
Hybrid cloud refers to mixed computing, storage, and services environment made up of on-premises infrastructure, private cloud 
services, and a public cloud—such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure—with orchestration among the various 
platforms.

Community Clouds
Community Cloud is a hybrid form of private cloud. They are multi-tenant platforms that enable different organizations to work 
on a shared platform. 
The purpose of this concept is to allow multiple customers to work on joint projects and applications that belong to the 
community, where it is necessary to have a centralized cloud infrastructure. In other words, Community Cloud is a distributed
infrastructure that solves the specific issues of business sectors by integrating the services provided by different types 
of cloud solutions.
The communities involved in these projects, such as tenders, business organizations, and research companies, focus on similar 
issues in their cloud interactions. Their shared interests may include concepts and policies related to security and compliance 
considerations, and the goals of the project as well.
Community Cloud computing facilitates its users to identify and analyze their business demands better. Community Cloud may be 
hosted in a data center, owned by one of the tenants, or by a third-party cloud services provider and can be either on-site or 
off-site.
 
 
What are the cloud service models?
Cloud services are infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to 
users through the internet. There are three main types of cloud service models: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. 

IaaS
IaaS, or infrastructure as a service, is on-demand access to cloud-hosted physical and virtual servers, storage, and networking 
- the backend IT infrastructure for running applications and workloads in the cloud. 

PaaS
PaaS, or platform as a service, is on-demand access to a complete, ready-to-use, cloud-hosted platform for developing, 
running, maintaining, and managing applications.

Saas
SaaS, or software as a service, is on-demand access to ready-to-use, cloud-hosted application software.
