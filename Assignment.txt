What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of hosting services that are provided to a client over the Internet. It Enable large-scale services without up-front investment. Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. Cloud services are controlled and monitored by the cloud provider through a pay-per-use business model. An ideal cloud computing platform is: 
•	Efficient in its use of resources
•	Scalable
•	Elastic
•	Self-managing
•	Highly available and accessible
•	Inter-operable and portable
Properties:
1.	Resource Efficient: Computing and network resources are pooled to provide services to multiple users. Resource allocation is dynamically adapted according to user demand.
2.	Elasticity: computing resources can be rapidly and elastically provisioned to scale up and released to scale down based on consumer’s demand.
3.	Self-managing services: a consumer can provision cloud services, such as web applications, server time, processing, storage, and network as needed and automatically without requiring human interaction with each service’s provider
4.	Accessible and highly available: cloud resources are available over the network anytime and anywhere and are accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by different types of platforms.













What are different types of clouds?
There are four primary cloud deployment models:
•	Public Cloud
•	Private Cloud
•	Community Cloud
•	Hybrid Cloud
Public Cloud:
Public clouds are owned by cloud service providers who charge for the use of cloud resources. Their Basic characteristics are:
1.	Homogeneous infrastructure
2.	Common policies
3.	Shared resources and multi-tenancy
4.	Leased or rented infrastructure
5.	Economies of scale
Some of the Public cloud examples are
1.	AWS/EC2 (Amazon)
2.	Azure (Microsoft)
3.	Google Cloud Platform.
4.	Rackspace.
Private Cloud:
The cloud infrastructure belongs to and is operated by only one organization. Their Basic characteristics are:
1.	Heterogeneous infrastructure
2.	Customized policies
3.	Dedicated resources
4.	In-house infrastructure
5.	End-to-end control
Some of the examples are:
1.	Eucalyptus System
2.	Open Nebula
3.	OpenStack
Community Cloud:
The cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations).
Hybrid Cloud:
The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability.



What are the Cloud Services Models?
Cloud computing is offered in three different service models which each satisfy a unique set of business requirements. These three models are known as 
•	Software as a Service (SaaS)
•	Platform as a Service (PaaS)
•	Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
Software as a Service (SaaS):
Software as a Service offers applications that are accessed over the web and are not managed by your company, but by the software provider. This relieves your organization from the constant pressure of software maintenance, infrastructure management, network security, data availability, and all the other operational issues involved with keeping applications up and running. This service model has the largest market share in cloud computing. 
Platform as a Service (PaaS):
Platform as a Service is halfway between Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). It offers access to a cloud-based environment in which users can build and deliver applications without the need of installing and working with IDEs, which are often very expensive. Additionally, users can often customize the features they want included with their subscription. PaaS has the smallest market share of the three service models.
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
Infrastructure as a service offers a standardized way of acquiring computing capabilities on demand and over the web. Such resources include storage facilities, networks, processing power, and virtual private servers. These are charged under a “pay as you go” model where you are billed by factors such as how much storage you use or the amount of processing power you consume over a certain timespan. In this service model, customers do not need to manage infrastructure, it is up to the provider to guarantee the contracted number of resources and availability.
