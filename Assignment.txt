Question 1: What is cloud computing?

"Cloud computing is the delivery of hosting services that are provided to a client over the Internet."
"Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources
(e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction."


Question 2: What are the different types of Cloud?

There are four primary cloud deployment models:
• Public Cloud
• Private Cloud
• Community Cloud
• Hybrid Cloud

1. Public Cloud:
Public clouds are owned by cloud service providers who charge for the use of cloud resources.
Basic characteristics:
• Homogeneous infrastructure, Common policies
• Shared resources and multi-tenancy
• Leased or rented infrastructure
• Economies of scale
Examples:
AWS/EC2 (Amazon)
Azure (Microsoft)
Google Cloud Platform
Rackspace

2. Private Cloud:
The cloud infrastructure belongs to and is operated by only one organization.
Private clouds usually reside behind a firewall and are utilized by a single organization. Authorized users can 
access, utilize, and store data in the private cloud from anywhere.
Examples:
Eucalyptus Systems
OpenNebula

3. Community Cloud:
The cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared 
concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations).

4. Hybrid Cloud:
The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or public) that remain unique 
entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability.


Question 3: What are the cloud service models?
There are three service models of cloud computing:
• IaaS
• PaaS
• SaaS

IaaS:
Infrastructure as a Service re online services that provide high-level APIs used to dereference various low-level 
details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc.

PaaS:
Platform as a Service is a cloud computing model where a third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools to users over the internet.

SaaS:
Software as a Service is a cloud computing model in which a cloud provider hosts applications and makes them available to end users over the internet.
In this model, an independent software vendor (ISV) may contract a third-party cloud provider to host the application.
