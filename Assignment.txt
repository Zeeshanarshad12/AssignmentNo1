Q1) What is cloud Computing?
Ans1:
Cloud computing is an evolution of information technology and a dominant business
model for delivering IT resources. With cloud computing, individuals and organizations 
can gain on-demand network access to a shared pool of managed and
scalable IT resources, such as servers, storage, and applications. Recently, academics
as well as practitioners have paid a great deal of attention to cloud computing. We
rely heavily on cloud services in our daily lives, e.g., for storing data, writing
documents, managing businesses, and playing games online. Cloud computing
also provides the infrastructure that has powered key digital trends such as mobile
computing, the Internet of Things, big data, and artificial intelligence, thereby
accelerating industry dynamics, disrupting existing business models, and fueling
the digital transformation. Still, cloud computing not only provides a vast number of
benefits and opportunities; it also comes with several challenges and concerns, e.g.,
regarding protecting customers’ data.

Benefit: One benefit of using cloud computing services is that firms can avoid the upfront
cost and complexity of owning and maintaining their own IT infrastructure, and instead simply
pay for what they use, when they use it.

Some Examples: Consumer services like Gmail or the cloud back-up of the photos on your smartphone,
though to the services which allow large enterprises to host all their data and run all of their
applications in the cloud. Netflix relies on cloud computing services to run its its video streaming
service and its other business systems too, and have a number of other organisations.

Q2) What are the different types of Cloud?
Ans2:
There are 4 types of clouds
1) Public Cloud:
Some public cloud examples include those offered by Amazon, Microsoft, or Google. These companies
provide both services and infrastructure, which are shared by all customers. Public clouds typically 
have massive amounts of available space, which translates into easy scalability. A public cloud is 
often recommended for software development and collaborative projects.
2) Private Cloud:
Private clouds usually reside behind a firewall and are utilized by a single organization. A completely 
on-premises cloud may be the preferred solution for businesses with very tight regulatory requirements, 
though private clouds implemented through a colocation provider are gaining in popularity. Authorized 
users can access, utilize, and store data in the private cloud from anywhere, just like they could with 
a public cloud. The difference is that no one else can access or utilize those computing resources. 
3) Hybrid Cloud:
Hybrid clouds combine public clouds with private clouds. They are designed to allow the two platforms 
to interact seamlessly, with data and applications moving smoothly from one to the other. It’s the 
perfect solution for a business or organization who needs a little bit of both options, usually 
dependent upon industry and size
4) Community Cloud:
Although not as commonly used as the other three models, community clouds are a collaborative, 
multi-tenant platform used by several distinct organizations to share the same applications. 
The users are typically operating within the same industry or field and share common concerns 
in terms of security, compliance, and performance.
In essence, a community cloud is a private cloud that functions much like a public cloud.


Q3) What are the cloud service models?
Ans3:
Cloud computing services come mainly in three types of service models: SaaS (Software as a Service), 
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), and PaaS (Platform as a Service). Each of the cloud models has its 
own set of benefits that could serve the needs of various businesses.
The following is a brief description of the three types of cloud models and their benefits.
1) SaaS:
SaaS or Software as a Service is a model that gives quick access to cloud-based web applications. 
The vendor controls the entire computing stack, which you can access using a web browser. 
These applications run on the cloud and you can use them by a paid licensed subscription or for 
free with limited access.
SaaS does not require any installations or downloads in your existing computing infrastructure. 
This eliminates the need for installing applications on each of your computers with the maintenance 
and support taken over by the vendor.  Some known examples of SaaS include Google G Suite, 
Microsoft Office 365, Dropbox, etc.
2) PaaS:
Platform as a Service or PaaS is essentially a cloud base where you can develop, test, and organize 
the different applications for your business. Implementing PaaS simplifies the process of enterprise 
software development. The virtual runtime environment provided by PaaS gives a favorable space for 
developing and testing applications.
The entire resources offered in the form of servers, storage, and networking are manageable either by 
the company or a platform provider. Google App Engine and AWS Elastic Beanstalk are two typical examples
of PaaS. PaaS is also subscription-based and gives you flexible pricing options depending on your 
business requirements.
3) IaaS:
IaaS or Infrastructure as a Service is basically a virtual provision of computing resources over the 
cloud. An IaaS cloud provider can give you the entire range of computing infrastructures such as storage,
servers, networking hardware alongside maintenance and support.
Businesses can opt for computing resources of their requirement without the need to install hardware on 
their premises.  Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Engine are some of the leading
IaaS cloud service providers.
