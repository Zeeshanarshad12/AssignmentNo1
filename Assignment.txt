What is cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is on-demand access, via the internet, to computing resources—applications, servers (physical servers and virtual servers),
data storage, development tools, networking capabilities, and more—hosted at a remote data center managed by a cloud services provider (or CSP).The CSP makes these resources available for a monthly 
subscription fee or bills them according to usage.

What are the different types of Cloud?
There are 4 main types of cloud computing: private clouds, public clouds, hybrid clouds, and multiclouds. There are also 3 main types of cloud computing services:
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platforms-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).
Public clouds:

Public clouds are cloud environments typically created from IT infrastructure not owned by the end user. Some of the largest public cloud providers include Alibaba Cloud,
Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.
Traditional public clouds always ran off-premises, but today's public cloud providers have started offering cloud services on clients’ on-premise data centers.
This has made location and ownership distinctions obsolete.All clouds become public clouds when the environments are partitioned and redistributed to multiple tenants.
Fee structures aren't necessary characteristics of public clouds anymore, since some cloud providers (like the Massachusettes Open Cloud) allow tenants to use their clouds for free.

Private clouds:
Private clouds are loosely defined as cloud environments solely dedicated to a single end user or group, where the environment usually runs behind that user or group's firewall.
All clouds become private clouds when the underlying IT infrastructure is dedicated to a single customer with completely isolated access.But private clouds no longer have to be sourced 
from on-prem IT infrastructure. Organizations are now building private clouds on rented, vendor-owned data centers located off-premises, which makes any location and ownership rules obsolete.

Hybrid clouds:

A hybrid cloud is a seemingly single IT environment created from multiple environments connected through local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), virtual private networks (VPNs), and/or APIs.
The characteristics of hybrid clouds are complex and the requirements can differ, depending on whom you ask. For example, a hybrid cloud may need to include:

At least 1 private cloud and at least 1 public cloud
2 or more private clouds
2 or more public clouds
A bare-metal or virtual environment connected to at least 1 public cloud or private cloud

Multiclouds

Multiclouds are a cloud approach made up of more than 1 cloud service, from more than 1 cloud vendor—public or private. All hybrid clouds are multiclouds, but not all multiclouds 
are hybrid clouds. Multiclouds become hybrid clouds when multiple clouds are connected by some form of integration or orchestration.A multicloud environment might exist on purpose 
(to better control sensitive data or as redundant storage space for improved disaster recovery) or by accident (usually the result of shadow IT). 
Either way, having multiple clouds is becoming more common across enterprises that seek to improve security and performance through an expanded portfolio of environments.



What are the cloud service models?
Cloud services are infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users through the internet. There are 3 main types of as-a-Service solutions: 
IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. Each facilitates the flow of user data from front-end clients through the internet, to the cloud service provider’s systems, and back—but vary by what’s provided.
