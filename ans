What is cloud Computing?
Ans:
Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. 
These resources include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software.

What are the different types of Cloud?

1.Public clouds
Public clouds are cloud environments typically created from IT infrastructure not owned by the end user. 

2. Private clouds
Private clouds are loosely defined as cloud environments solely dedicated to a single end user or group, where the environment usually runs behind that user or group's firewall. 
All clouds become private clouds when the underlying IT infrastructure is dedicated to a single customer with completely isolated access.
3. Hybrid clouds
A hybrid cloud is a seemingly single IT environment created from multiple environments connected through local area networks (LANs), 
wide area networks (WANs), virtual private networks (VPNs), and/or APIs.
4. Multiclouds
Multiclouds are a cloud approach made up of more than 1 cloud service, from more than 1 cloud vendorâ€”public or private.

What are the cloud service models?

Cloud computing is offered in three different service models which each satisfy a unique set of business requirements.
These three models are known as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service
